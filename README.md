# House-Price-Prediction
Predicting house prices using machine learning is a popular task in the field of data science. Here's a general outline of the steps that i follow to build a house price prediction model using machine learning

1) Data Collection: Obtain a dataset that includes features related to the houses, such as square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, age of the house, etc., along with their corresponding sale prices.

2) Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing irrelevant features, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding).

3) Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns in the data. For example, you could create a feature representing the ratio of the number of bedrooms to the total square footage.

4) Splitting the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

5) Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for the prediction task. Some common algorithms for regression tasks like house price prediction include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests and Support Vector Regression.

6) Model Training: Train the selected machine learning algorithm using the training dataset. The model will learn the patterns and relationships between the input features and the house prices.

7) Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared (R2) to assess how well the model predicts house prices.

8) Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters to optimize its performance. This process involves experimenting with different parameter values and selecting the best combination.

9) Prediction: Once i have a well-performing model, it predict house prices for new data points or real-world scenarios.
